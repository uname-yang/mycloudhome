__WD has changed the policy of login. The username and password is not possible now. So I disable this auto-fetch token interface. Please get your token by yourself. And use `mycloudhome login --username XXX --token XXX` instead !!!__

> hints: F11 on Chrome and monitor the xhr like: `POST https://auth0.accounts.westerndigital.com/oauth/token HTTP/2.0`. The access_token in the respond body is what we want.

## Install

```bash
pip3 install mycloudhome
```
